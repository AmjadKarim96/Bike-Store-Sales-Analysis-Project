# Bike Store Sales Analysis Project

Welcome to the Bike Store Sales Analysis project!📊 In this project, I've utilized SQL, Excel, and Tableau to dive deep into the data, uncover key performance indicators, and drive strategic decision-making.

## Key Insights:

🔹 Total Revenue / Year**: Provides a bird's-eye view of annual sales performance, highlighting growth trends and opportunities for expansion. 

🔹 Total Revenue / Month**: Offers a granular perspective on monthly sales dynamics, facilitating agile decision-making and resource allocation. 

🔹 Revenue per State**: Understands regional sales patterns and identifies lucrative markets for targeted marketing efforts.

🔹 Revenue per Store**: Evaluates the performance of individual stores, optimizing inventory management, and enhancing operational efficiency.

🔹 Revenue per Product Category**: Unveils insights into product category preferences, guiding product development and marketing strategies. 

🔹 Top 10 Customers**: Recognizes and rewards loyal customers, fostering customer loyalty and driving repeat business. 

## Additional Analysis:

But that's not all! In addition to SQL analysis, I've harnessed the power of Excel pivot tables and dashboards to transform raw data into actionable insights. And to take the analysis even further, I've crafted an interactive and visually compelling sales performance dashboard in Tableau, providing a dynamic way to explore the data and extract insights.
